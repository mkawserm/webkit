        [GTK] Fix build with Clang after r219605.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166682

        Unreviewed build fix.

        Clang-3.8 complains with the following error:
        non-constant-expression cannot be narrowed from type 'gboolean' (aka 'int') to 'bool' in initializer list [-Wc++11-narrowing]

        * glib/SessionHostGlib.cpp: insert an explicit cast to silence this issue.

        Add initial implementation of WebDriver process to run the HTTP server
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166682

        Reviewed by Brian Burg.

        Add WebDriver process that runs the HTTP server and implements an initial set of commands. Most of the code is
        cross-platform, only the HTTP server implementation, the code to launch the browser and the communication with
        the remote inspector requires platform specific code. This patch includes the GTK port implementation, using
        libsoup for the HTTP server, and GLib for launching the browser and communicating with the remote
        inspector. This implementation follows the w3c spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver) as close as possible, but
        using the official selenium python tests as reference.
